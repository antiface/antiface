### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a long-term project called The Refcards-Project, which is a kind of cross between a library card catalog and a primitive internet based entirely on index cards and collections of index cards with references to one another;
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more and more about Python, trying to learn how to make GUIs and work with Flask to make simple web apps;
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects on GitHub;
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me on Twitter at [@antisignal](https://twitter.com/antisignal).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an interdisciplinary artist-researcher. That's what I was in my previous life before learning computer science and programming; I'm on my 9th year of programming and it's funny because I've been programming for almost a decade and I don't have much to show for it; mostly I just understand the Python language really well and can read and write code fluently, even if I don't have any major projects to show for;
