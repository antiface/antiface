### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a long-term project called The Refcards-Project, which is a kind of cross between a library card catalog and a primitive internet based entirely on index cards and collections of index cards with references to one another;
- I'm also working on a new novel and interdisciplinary art-research project called The Archives-Project;
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more and more about Python, trying to learn how to make GUIs and work with Flask to make simple web apps; I've been reading the books Fluent Python, CPython Internals, and Neural Networks From Scratch in Python;
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects on GitHub;
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me on Twitter at [@antisignal](https://twitter.com/antisignal);
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at the same handle on Mastodon at [@antisignal](https://me.dm/@antisignal);
- I'm also on [Substack](https://antisignal.substack.com/);
- I have a [Personal Website](https://alexgagnon.com/) where you can get information about my *Projects*;
- I have a [Professional Website for my Historiotheque Concept, My Art-Design-Research Laboratories](https://historiotheque.ca/);
- I am also write songs and do ambient, experimental sound design:
    - [Songs Playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrwvc22vCTExvwto9dEX7IdNc4wJwF5gS);
    - [Songs Playlist on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/beautifulsignals/sets/songs-from-the-history-project);
    - [Ambient, experimental sound design blog on Tumblr](https://beautifulsignals.tumblr.com/);
- [I also have a Playlist on Youtube with some of my Philosophical Lectures, a.k.a. _*Extreme Phiosophy*_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrwvc22vCTEwOF2j5nPaksODyCPjE3XQU);
- âš¡ Fun fact: As I said above, I'm an interdisciplinary artist-researcher. That's what I was in my previous life before learning computer science and programming; I'm on my 12th year of programming and it's funny because I've been programming for over a decade and I don't have much to show for it; mostly I just understand the Python language (Internals, etc.) really well and can read and write code fluently, even if I don't have any major projects to show for (I spend hours reading other people's code on GitHub as part of my daily disciplinary practice; I think *Reading Code* is too often overlooked);
- Most of my repositories on this GitHub account don't actually contain code, just ideas and concepts, conceptual systems, *Art-Research Projects*, novels ,etc.; if you want to see an Index of my repositories check [Index](https://github.com/antiface/Index);
